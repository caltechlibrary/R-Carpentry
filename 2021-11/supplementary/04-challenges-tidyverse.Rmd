# Challenge 4.1 - Subsetting using select() and filter()

Using pipes, subset the surveys data to include animals collected before 1995 and retain only the columns year, sex, and weight.

## Answer

surveys %>%
    filter(year < 1995) %>%
    select(year, sex, weight)
    
# Challenge 4.2 - Modifying a data frame with mutate()

Create a new data frame from the `surveys` data that meets the following criteria: contains only the `species_id` column and a new column called `hindfoot_cm` containing the `hindfoot_length` values (currently in mm) converted to centimeters. In this `hindfoot_cm` column, there are no `NA`s and all values are less than 3.
**Hint**: think about how the commands should be ordered to produce this data frame!

## Answer

surveys_hindfoot_cm <- surveys %>%
    filter(!is.na(hindfoot_length)) %>%
    mutate(hindfoot_cm = hindfoot_length / 10) %>%
    filter(hindfoot_cm < 3) %>%
    select(species_id, hindfoot_cm)

# Challenge 4.3 - Working with count():

1. How many animals were caught in each `plot_type` surveyed?
2. Use `group_by()` and `summarize()` to find the mean, min, and max
hindfoot length for each species (using `species_id`). Also add the 
number of observations (hint: see `?n`).
3. What was the heaviest animal measured in each year? Return the columns `year`, `genus`, 
`species_id`, and `weight`.

## Answer

1. 
surveys %>%
    count(plot_type)
2.
surveys %>%
    filter(!is.na(hindfoot_length)) %>%
    group_by(species_id) %>%
    summarize(
        mean_hindfoot_length = mean(hindfoot_length),
        min_hindfoot_length = min(hindfoot_length),
        max_hindfoot_length = max(hindfoot_length),
        n = n()
    )
3.
surveys %>%
    filter(!is.na(weight)) %>%
    group_by(year) %>%
    filter(weight == max(weight)) %>%
    select(year, genus, species, weight) %>%
    arrange(year)

# Challenge 4.4 - Reshaping

1. Spread the surveys data frame with `year` as columns, `plot_id` as rows, and the number of genera per plot as the values. You will need to summarize before reshaping, and use the function `n_distinct()` to get the number of unique genera within a particular chunk of data. It’s a powerful function! See `?n_distinct` for more.

2. Now take that data frame and gather() it again, so each row is a unique plot_id by year combination.

3. The `surveys` data set has two measurement columns: `hindfoot_length` and `weight`. This makes it difficult to do things like look at the relationship between mean values of each measurement per year in different plot types. Let’s walk through a common solution for this type of problem. First, use `gather()` to create a dataset where we have a key column called `measurement` and a value column that takes on the value of either `hindfoot_length` or `weight`. Hint: You’ll need to specify which columns are being gathered.

4. With this new data set, calculate the average of each measurement in each year for each different `plot_type`. Then `spread()` them into a data set with a column for `hindfoot_length` and `weight`. Hint: You only need to specify the key and value columns for `spread()`.

## Answer

1.
surveys_spread_genera <- surveys %>%
  group_by(plot_id, year) %>%
  summarize(n_genera = n_distinct(genus)) %>%
  spread(year, n_genera)

head(surveys_spread_genera)

2.
surveys_spread_genera %>%
  gather("year", "n_genera", -plot_id)

3.
surveys_long <- surveys %>%
  gather("measurement", "value", hindfoot_length, weight)

4.
surveys_long %>%
  group_by(year, measurement, plot_type) %>%
  summarize(mean_value = mean(value, na.rm=TRUE)) %>%
  spread(measurement, mean_value)
