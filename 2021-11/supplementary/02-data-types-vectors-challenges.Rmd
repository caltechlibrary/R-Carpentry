> ### Challenge 2.1
>
> What are the values after each statement in the following?

```{r}
mass <- 47.5            # mass?
age  <- 122             # age?
mass <- mass * 2.0      # mass?
age  <- age - 20        # age?
mass_index <- mass/age  # mass_index?
```

> * Weâ€™ve seen that atomic vectors can be of type character,
>   numeric (or double), integer, and logical. But what happens if we try to mix these types in
>   a single vector?
>
> * What will happen in each of these examples? (hint: use `class()`
>   to check the data type of your objects):
>
> `> num_char <- c(1, 2, 3, "a")`
>
> `> num_logical <- c(1, 2, 3, TRUE)`
>
> `> char_logical <- c("a", "b", "c", TRUE)`
>
> `> tricky <- c(1, 2, 3, "4")`
>
> * Why do you think it happens?
>
> * How many values in `combined_logical` are `"TRUE"` (as a character) in the
>   following example:
>
> `> num_logical <- c(1, 2, 3, TRUE)`
>
> `> char_logical <- c("a", "b", "c", TRUE)`
>
> `> combined_logical <- c(num_logical, char_logical)`
>
> * You've probably noticed that objects of different types get
>   converted into a single, shared type within a vector. In R, we
>   call converting objects from one class into another class
>   _coercion_. These conversions happen according to a hierarchy,
>   whereby some types get preferentially coerced into other
>   types. Can you draw a diagram that represents the hierarchy of how
>   these data types are coerced?


> ### Challenge 2.3
>
> 1. Using  the following vector of heights in inches, create a new vector, `heights_no_na`, 
> with the NAs removed.
>
> `> heights <- c(63, 69, 60, 65, NA, 68, 61, 70, 61, 59, 64, 69, 63, 63, NA, 72, 65, 64, 70, 63, 65)`
>
> 2. Use the function `median()` to calculate the median of the `heights` vector.
>
> 3. Use R to figure out how many people in the set are taller than 67 inches.
