### About R Notebooks

This is an [R Markdown Notebook](https://rmarkdown.rstudio.com/r_notebooks.html). When you 
execute code within the notebook, the results appear beneath the code.

Briefly, R Markdown is a simple way to create documents with formatting by using specific 
symbols and characters. Programs capable of reading R Markdown can render a nicely formatted 
document. This is similar to the way that HTML files are text documents with 
specific tags, which are read by specific programs (web browsers, etc.) that apply those tags 
to the text, interpret the formatting, apply it to the document, and display it. R Markdown 
files (and R Notebooks) have the base file extension *.Rmd. An R 
Notebook will have the line output: html_notebook in the header. 

R Notebooks have a few extra features over regular R Markdown documents:

* When you execute code in a Notebook, it is done line by line, so it can be easier to check 
execution for errors. In a regular R Markdown document, code is executed all at once.

* You can *Preview* your notebook using the *Preview* button - this displays a rendered HTML 
copy of the contents of the editor, but does not actually run any code. This makes it a bit
faster to check your output.

* When you save your notebook, it creates a special *.nb.html file, which is actually a package 
of the HTML rendering (of the page, with the code sections as separate image files in their own 
directory) and the Markdown file. This can be shared with others and opened like a regular fine 
from within RStudio.


### Text Formatting

To create a new R Markdown Notebook in RStudio, select File -> New File -> R Notebook.

You can enter text into a Notebook as you normally would into any other text document and use Markdown conventions to format it.

Enter text between the double asterisks below to format it as bold:
** **

Enter text between the underscores below to format it as italic:
_ _

Click Preview when you are finished to view your changes.

Take advantage of this to document your code and data to keep it readable, understandable, and reproducible!


### Embedding Code Chunks

You can embed R code into Notebooks by using chunks, set off above and below by three reverse ticks: ``` 

Try executing this chunk by clicking the *Run* button (small green arrow) within the chunk or by placing your cursor 
inside it and pressing *Cmd+Shift+Enter*.

```{r}
a <- 17
b <- 34
a + b
```

The designation {r} tells the Notebook that this is executable R code.

Here's another example - run it the same way:

```{r cars_plot}
plot(cars)
```

The 'cars' dataset is an example dataset built into R, and the 'plot' command is a basic R command to create a default plot of 
simple data. We'll talk more about plotting using ggplot later on in this workshop.

Note the addition of *cars_plot* in the {r} designation - this is the name of the code chunk. This can be used to 
navigate your Notebook using the menu in the lower left of the document window. It is also used when you are calling 
an external R script into a Notebook, and we'll see an example of that in the next example. You can also add sections to your document using headings designated by `###` - you'll learn more about that tomorrow.

Add a new chunk in the space below by clicking the *Insert Chunk* button on the toolbar 
or by pressing *Cmd+Option+I*.

1. Name your chunk 'math_trick_nb_example'.
2. Perform the following operations:
3. Assign your shoe size to a variable.
4. Multiply this variable by 5.
5. Add 50.
6. Multiply by 20.
7. Add 1018 (1019 if you have already had your birthday this year)
8. Subtract the year you were born.
9. Display the answer.

Insert your code chunk here:


If you wanted to call this **script** in multiple Notebooks, you could save it as an R code file:

1. Click File -> New File -> R Script.
2. Copy and paste your code into the new file.
3. Add the line `## ---- math_trick` at the top of your file.
4. Save your file as `math_trick.R`.
5. In your R Notebook, load the script using an `{r setup}` using the `knitr::read_chunk()` function as such:

```{r setup}
knitr::read_chunk("math_trick.R")
```

Note that nothing will display.

6. You can now call this R script using ```{r math_trick}``` in an otherwise empty code chunk as such:

```{r math_trick}
```


### Save and Preview

After you save the notebook, an HTML file containing the code and output will be saved
alongside it when you click the *Preview* button (or press *Cmd+Shift+K*) to preview 
the HTML file.
