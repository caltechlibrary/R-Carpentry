<h2>Required Computer Setup</h2>

<p>The Carpentries&rsquo; teaching is hands-on, so participants are encouraged to use
their own computers to insure the proper setup of tools for an efficient
workflow. <em>These lessons assume no prior knowledge of the skills or tools</em>, but
working through this lesson requires working copies of the software described
below. To most effectively use these materials, please make sure to install
everything <em>before</em> working through this lesson.</p>

<p><strong>R</strong> and <strong>RStudio</strong> are separate downloads and installations. R is the
underlying statistical computing environment. RStudio is a graphical integrated
development environment (IDE) that makes using R easier and more interactive.
<strong>You need to install R before you install RStudio.</strong></p>

<h3>If you don&rsquo;t have R and RStudio installed:</h3>

<ol>
<li><p>Download R Version 3.5.2 from the CRAN website for your operating system:</p>

<ul>
<li><a href="http://cran.r-project.org/bin/windows/base/release.htm">Windows</a></li>
<li><a href="http://cran.r-project.org/bin/macosx/">Mac OS</a></li>
<li><a href="https://cloud.r-project.org/bin/linux">Linux</a> (Information provided to get the most recent version of R for common distributions.)</li>
<li>Note that 3.5.3 is due to be released on
March 11 - please do not upgrade during the workshop unless you have a pressing
need to do so.</li>
</ul></li>

<li><p>Open the <code>.exe</code> (Windows) or <code>.pkg</code> (Mac) just downloaded to install R. For Linux, follow the
directions given on the website for your particular distribution.</p>

<ul>
<li>If you are a Mac user, it is also a good idea to install <a href="https://www.xquartz.org/">XQuartz</a> (needed by some R packages).</li>
</ul></li>

<li><p>Go to the <a href="https://www.rstudio.com/products/rstudio/download/#download">RStudio download page</a> and
download the latest version of RStudio for your platform (1.1.463 or later).</p></li>

<li><p>Open the downloaded file and install RStudio.</p></li>

<li><p>Once it&rsquo;s installed, open RStudio to make sure it works and you don&rsquo;t get any error messages, and the Console window shows the
correct version of R installed (should be 3.5.2).</p></li>
</ol>

<h3>If you already have R and RStudio installed:</h3>

<ol>
<li><p>Open RStudio, and click on &ldquo;Help&rdquo; &gt; &ldquo;Check for updates&rdquo;. If a new version is
available, quit RStudio, and download the latest version of RStudio from the
<a href="https://www.rstudio.com/products/rstudio/download/#download">RStudio download page</a>.</p></li>

<li><p>To check which version of R you are using, start RStudio and check the Console window. The first line that appears in the Console indicates the version of R that is running. Alternatively, you can type <code>sessionInfo()</code>, which will also display which version of R is running.</p></li>

<li><p>If you are not running 3.5.2, please see Steps 1 and 2 above under &ldquo;If you don&rsquo;t have R and RStudio installed&rdquo;.</p>

<ul>
<li>You can <a href="https://cran.r-project.org/bin/windows/base/rw-FAQ.html#How-do-I-UNinstall-R_003f">check here</a> for more information on how to remove old versions from your system if you wish to do so.</li>
</ul></li>
</ol>
