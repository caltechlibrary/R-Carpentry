<h2>What is R? What is RStudio?</h2>

<p>The term &ldquo;<code>R</code>&rdquo; is used to refer to both the programming language and the
software that interprets the scripts written using it.</p>

<p><a href="https://rstudio.com">RStudio</a> is currently a very popular way to not only write
your R scripts but also to interact with the R software. To function correctly,
RStudio needs R and therefore both need to be installed on your computer.</p>

<h2>Why learn R?</h2>

<h3>R does not involve lots of pointing and clicking, and that&rsquo;s a good thing</h3>

<p>The learning curve might be steeper than with other software, but with R, the
results of your analysis do not rely on remembering a succession of pointing
and clicking, but instead on a series of written commands, and that&rsquo;s a good
thing! So, if you want to redo your analysis because you collected more data,
you don&rsquo;t have to remember which button you clicked in which order to obtain
your results; you just have to run your script again.</p>

<p>Working with scripts makes the steps you used in your analysis clear, and the
code you write can be inspected by someone else who can give you feedback and
spot mistakes.</p>

<p>Working with scripts forces you to have a deeper understanding of what you are
doing, and facilitates your learning and comprehension of the methods you use.</p>

<h3>R code is great for reproducibility</h3>

<p>Reproducibility is when someone else (including your future self) can obtain the
same results from the same dataset when using the same analysis.</p>

<p>R integrates with other tools to generate manuscripts from your code. If you
collect more data, or fix a mistake in your dataset, the figures and the
statistical tests in your manuscript are updated automatically.</p>

<p>An increasing number of journals and funding agencies expect analyses to be
reproducible, so knowing R will give you an edge with these requirements.</p>

<h3>R is interdisciplinary and extensible</h3>

<p>With 10,000+ packages that can be installed to extend its capabilities, R
provides a framework that allows you to combine statistical approaches from many
scientific disciplines to best suit the analytical framework you need to analyze your
data. For instance, R has packages for image analysis, GIS, time series, population
genetics, and a lot more.</p>

<h3>R works on data of all shapes and sizes</h3>

<p>The skills you learn with R scale easily with the size of your dataset. Whether
your dataset has hundreds or millions of lines, it won&rsquo;t make much difference to
you.</p>

<p>R is designed for data analysis. It comes with special data structures and data
types that make handling of missing data and statistical factors convenient.</p>

<p>R can connect to spreadsheets, databases, and many other data formats, on your
computer or on the web.</p>

<h3>R produces high-quality graphics</h3>

<p>The plotting functionalities in R are endless, and allow you to adjust any
aspect of your graph to convey most effectively the message from your data.</p>

<h3>R has a large and welcoming community</h3>

<p>Thousands of people use R daily. Many of them are willing to help you through
mailing lists and websites such as <a href="https://stackoverflow.com/">Stack Overflow</a>,
or on the <a href="https://community.rstudio.com/">RStudio community</a>.</p>

<h3>Not only is R free, but it is also open-source and cross-platform</h3>

<p>Anyone can inspect the source code to see how R works. Because of this
transparency, there is less chance for mistakes, and if you (or someone else)
find some, you can report and fix bugs.</p>
