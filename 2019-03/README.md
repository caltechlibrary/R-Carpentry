## Required Computer Setup

The Carpentries' teaching is hands-on, so participants are encouraged to use
their own computers to insure the proper setup of tools for an efficient
workflow. *These lessons assume no prior knowledge of the skills or tools*, but
working through this lesson requires working copies of the software described
below. To most effectively use these materials, please make sure to install
everything *before* working through this lesson.

**R** and **RStudio** are separate downloads and installations. R is the
underlying statistical computing environment. RStudio is a graphical integrated
development environment (IDE) that makes using R easier and more interactive.
