# Deep Dive Lesson for ggplot2 using R and RStudio

This project tracks iterations of a lesson developed for teaching an introduction 
to the ggplot2 package in R using RStudio. The lesson involves learners working 
through a R Markdown notebook using data from the [Periodic Table package by Julien IdÃ©](https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/PeriodicTable/index.html).

The lesson is designed to take approximately 3.5 hours of class time (with breaks), 
taught in a [Carpentry-like style](https://carpentries.org).

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

* Most recent version of R preferred, or any version >3.4.3 as this lesson requires tidyverse
* Most recent version of RStudio
* Basic familiarity with R and RStudio

### Installing

There are two ways to use this repository:

1. Download the learner file and work through the .Rmd notebook file. The most recent 
(July 2019) version can be downloaded as a zip file here:
[https://github.com/caltechlibrary/R-Deep-Dive-ggplot2/blob/master/2019-07-19/2019-07-19-R_Deep_Dive_ggplot2.Rmd.zip](https://github.com/caltechlibrary/R-Deep-Dive-ggplot2/blob/master/2019-07-19/2019-07-19-R_Deep_Dive_ggplot2.Rmd.zip)

2. View/clone/fork the entire repository to view all past versions and versions in 
development. The repository is designed as an RStudio Project (hence the .R-Deep-Dive-ggplot2.Rproj file), so it can be downloaded and opened directly from 
within RStudio. The versions are organized by dates the class was taught on-campus at Caltech. Any working version will be in a directory labeled 'Current'.
